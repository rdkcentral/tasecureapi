- Feature Name: (a unique identifier for the feature - _my\_awesome\_feature_)

## Introduction

A short description of what the feature is. Try to keep it to a single-paragraph "elevator pitch"
so the reader understands what problem this proposal is addressing.

## Motivation / use-cases

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Updates/Obsoletes

Include a list of any RFCs that are updated by this RFC. Include a list of any RFCs that are
obsoleted by this RFC.

## Affected platforms

List the platforms that this proposal would affect.

## Open Source Dependencies

List any open source dependencies and associated version requirements (e.g. openssl).

## Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the
SecAPI to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement. This should
get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new
terminology should be defined here.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives considered

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?

## Future possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would
affect the project as a whole in a holistic way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully
consider all possible interactions with the project in your proposal.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the RFC you are writing but
otherwise related.
