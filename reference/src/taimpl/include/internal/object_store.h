/** @section Description
 * @file object_store.h
 *
 * This file contains the functions and structures implementing an object store. Object store
 * stores the objects and provides a slot identifier for referencing them.
 *
 * Object store ensures that only the owner of a specific object can access it. Additionally, it
 * provides a mechanism for ensuring that the contained objects are not deleted while in use.
