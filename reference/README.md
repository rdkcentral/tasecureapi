# Comcast Security API v3+

## Summary

This library is the reference implementation of the Comcast Security API v3+. SoC vendors are
responsible for implementing this layer, including both the REE client interface and TA client
interface, as well as the backing implementation in TEE.

In this reference implementation, the functionality is implemented using OpenSSL.

## Directories

### 'client'

This directory contains the client facing SecAPI headers, as well as the unit test suite for the
SecAPI.

This folder should be copied over from the reference implementation to the SoC vendor
implementation as-is, without any changes. Comcast will update the reference implementation and
unit tests over time and will expect SoC vendors to keep this folder up to date. Some unit tests,
like sa_key_import_soc.cpp, may need to be modified by the vendor, especially if the vendor library
does not support a particular feature. The vendor must declare to Comcast which unit tests have been
modified.

### 'clientimpl'

This directory contains the reference implementation of the SecAPI client library that dispatches
client calls to the SecAPI TA. It is responsible for the serialization of parameters and transport
to the TA.

Client implementation library is required to be ported to both the host (REE) environment for use
by client applications, as well as the TEE environment for use by TA clients.

Only the files in the 'internal' directory need to be modified.

clientimpl code performs the marshaling of calls from API calls into the TA. Some TEEs require
communication through shared memory, others may be able to use standard memory between the processor
and the TEE. To use shared memory, define the compile time flag USE_SHARED_MEMORY. Vendors must
implement the client-side functions: ta_open_session, ta_close_session, ta_invoke_command,
ta_alloc_shared_memory, and ta_free_shared_memory which are defined in ta.h. Example implementations
are in ta_client.c. Vendors must also implement code to call the TA-side functions:
ta_open_session_handler, ta_close_session_handler, and ta_invoke_command_handler which also defined
in ta.h. ta.h also defines the macros, controlled by the compile time USE_SHARED_MEMORY flag, that
determine whether shared memory or standard memory is used by the client-side library.

Vendors must implement code identified by ```TODO SoC Vendor```.

### 'taimpl'

This directory contains the reference implementation of the SecAPI TA. TA is responsible for
servicing client requests.

Only the files in the include/internal, include/porting, src/internal, and src/porting directories
need to be modified. All other code in the src and include directories is platform independent and
should not be modified.

Vendors must implement code identified by ```TODO SoC Vendor```.

### 'util'

This directory contains common functions that are used by both the REE client as well as the TA
implementation. This directory contains code to read a secret symmetric root key from a PKCS 12
key store. This code is only used by the reference implementation and allows the reference
implementation to be used for testing purposes with a key that is delivered by a keying provider.
The reference implementation provides a default test root key in the file root_keystore.p12 that is
encrypted with a default password. This default password is embedded in the common.h file to
facilitate ease of testing. If a test root key is provided by a keying provider, the keying provider
should use a different password to the PKCS 12 key store. To change the default test PKCS 12 key 
store and password for the reference implementation and for executing the tests, set the
ROOT_KEYSTORE environment variable with the location of the PKCS 12 key store file and the 
ROOT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD environment variable with the password.

NOTE - OpenSSL does not support PKCS 12 Secret Bags since there is no industry specification for the
contents of a Secret Bag. This implementation reads a PKCS 12 key store that is created by Java's
keytool application, which creates a proprietary format of a Secret Bag.

## Building

Generate make files using `cmake`
Add -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<directory> to install to a non-standard install directory.

The build assumes that the following packages have already been installed:
YAJL - include -DYAJL_ROOT=<directory> if not found
OPENSSL - include -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=<directory> if not found

OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 3.0.0+ is supported. OpenSSL 1.1.1j+ is supported.

SOC and root key tests are also disabled by default. To enable these tests, add -DENABLE_SOC_KEY_TESTS=1. The TEST_KEY
key defined in sa_key_common.cpp must match the root key defined on the test device for these tests to pass.

```
cmake -S . -B cmake-build
```

Build reference implementation and unit tests

```
cmake --build cmake-build
```

Run unit test suite

```
cmake --build cmake-build --target test
```
or
```
cd cmake-build
ctest -V
```

To test for memory leaks

```
cd cmake-build
ctest -T memcheck
```

### Install

To install SecApi 3 (libsaclient), run a cmake install

```
cmake --install cmake-build
```

This copies the include files, the library, libsaclient.(so/dll/dylib) containing the SecAPI code (the
extension .so/.dll/.dylib created depends on which platform you are building on), and the test application,
saclienttest and taimpltest, to their appropriate locations on the system.

### Build artifacts

#### saclient

This is a client library that client applications link against. It exposes the public, platform
independent SecAPI header files, and links with the platform specific client implementation library
(saclientimpl).  Comcast is responsible for maintaining the public headers exposed by the SecAPI,
while the SoC vendors are responsible for implementing the client library.

#### saclienttest

This is a SecAPI unit test suite that uses the SecAPI public interfaces to test the functionality
of the implementation.  It links against saclient. Comcast is responsible for implementing these
tests.

#### saclientimpl

This is a library that implements the SecAPI client interfaces. This library is implemented by the
SoC vendor and it conforms to the interfaces specified in saclient.

#### taimpl

This component is the SecAPI TA that is responsible for processing client requests. The TA is
intended to run in a TEE.

## Versioning

SecAPI version is specified using 4 numbers. The first 3 contain the major, minor, and point release
of the SecAPI specification document that this release has implemented. This version triplet is
specified in the src/client/include/sa.h file under the SA_SPECIFICATION_VERSION macro. Comcast is
responsible for updating the version number in this file.  Please see https://semver.org/
for reference.

An additional number is added for specifying an implementation revision for a particular spec
version. SoC vendors are responsible for updating this number with every revision of their
implementation. The full 4 number version can be retrieved using the sa_get_version() call.

## Porting guidance

### Suggested procedure for porting the SecAPI

1. Copy the reference implementation repo.
1. Replace the name of the project in ./CMakeLists.txt.
1. Modify files in src/clientimpl/src/internal, src/taimpl/include/internal,
   src/taimpl/include/porting, src/taimpl/src/internal, and src/taimpl/src/porting folders with
   platform specific implementation for a given platform.
1. Keep all folder except the ones mentioned in 3) up to date with reference implementation
   regularly.

### Secure Heap

SoC vendors are expected to provide memory allocation and de-allocation functions for secure heap if
available on the target platform (memory_secure_alloc, memory_secure_realloc, memory_secure_free).
The secure heap shall be used for storing unencrypted key material while in use.

## Coding Standards

The clang-format library is used to format all code according to the settings in the associated 
.clang-format file. All attempts were used to use descriptive variable names and predefined
constants instead of magic numbers. When the OpenSSL library is used, standard OpenSSL usage
convention is followed by testing return values against the value 1 which represents success.
